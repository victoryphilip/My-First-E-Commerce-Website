        For those bright, sunshiny days, the Super Retina XDR display now reaches a peak of 2000 nits outdoors — that’s twice as bright as before and the highest peak brightness of any smartphone. So text jumps right off the screen.
        </h2>

        <p>
            <h2>
                Photos and HDR videos get a big boost, too — up to 1600 nits peak brightness, bringing iPhone to the same level as the Pro Display XDR. Movies, shows, and even the films you’ve shot on iPhone look more true to life than ever.
