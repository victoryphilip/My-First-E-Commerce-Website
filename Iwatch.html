            To build the ultimate sports watch, we crafted every element with painstaking attention to detail for unparalleled performance. Titanium strikes the perfect balance between weight, ruggedness, and corrosion resistance. The new case design rises up to surround the flat sapphire crystal and protect it from edge impacts. The Digital Crown is larger and the side button is raised from the case, making them easier to use while you’re wearing gloves.

            Hike, run, dive. There’s a band for that. Making the ultimate sports watch for athletes of all kinds required a unique approach. That’s why specialized bands for outdoor adventures, endurance training, and water sports are as meticulously crafted as the watch itself.
